 A web application for detecting fake news using NLP with Hugging Face Transformers. The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, and the backend uses Node.js, Express, and a pre-trained facebook/bart-large-mnli model for zero-shot classification.

 ## Setup with GitHub

 1. **Create a GitHub Repository**:
    - Go to GitHub and create a new repository named news-analyzer.
    - Initialize it with a README and .gitignore for Node.js.

 2. **Push Code**:
    - Clone the repository locally:
      
bash
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-analyzer.git
      cd news-analyzer

    - Copy all files from this project into the repository.
    - Commit and push:
      
bash
      git add .
      git commit -m "Initial commit with fake news detection app"
      git push origin main


 3. **Use GitHub Codespaces**:
    - Open the repository in GitHub.
    - Click the "Code" button and select "Create codespace on main".
    - Codespaces will set up the environment using .devcontainer/devcontainer.json.
    - Once the environment is ready, run:
      
bash
      npm run dev

    - Access the frontend at https://<codespace-name>-5173.app.github.dev and backend at https://<codespace-name>-3001.app.github.dev.

 4. **Deploy with GitHub Actions**:
    - Set up a Render account and create a new Node.js service.
    - Obtain your RENDER_API_KEY and RENDER_SERVICE_ID from Render.
    - In GitHub, go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret.
    - Add RENDER_API_KEY and RENDER_SERVICE_ID.
    - Push changes to the main branch to trigger the deployment workflow.

 ## Project Structure

 - .devcontainer/: Codespaces configuration
 - .github/workflows/: GitHub Actions workflows
 - src/client/: Frontend React application
   - components/: Reusable UI components
   - pages/: Page components
   - services/: API and analysis logic
 - src/server/: Backend Express server
   - server.ts: Main server file with Hugging Face Transformers integration

 ## Notes

 - The NLP analysis uses facebook/bart-large-mnli for zero-shot classification, enhanced with rule-based checks.
 - For production, consider fine-tuning a model specifically for fake news detection or using a cloud-based NLP service.
 - Ensure the backend URL in connectanalyzer.tsx is updated to the deployed backend URL after deployment.
 - The frontend uses Tailwind CSS and Radix UI for styling and components.
